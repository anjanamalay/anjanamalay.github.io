<h1> Reccomended Courses at UM for CS Majors </h1>

<p>
    From my expereince I think that the courses you want to take are really depedant
    on what you want to do after graduation for your full-time job. However here's a list
    of courses that I think provide a good base for anyone in the tech field

<ul>
    <li>EECS 183: Elementary Programming Conepts</li>
    <li>EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures</li>
    <li>EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>EECS 201: Computer Science Pragmatics</li>
    <li>EECS 485: Web Systems</li>
</ul>
